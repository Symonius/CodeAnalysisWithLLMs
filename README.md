# CodeAnalysisWithLLMs
This repository consists of two programs: A python program ("vularis") which reads files from a specified directory, formulates API requests to an LLM and generates a JSON vulnerability report. Furthermore, a web application ("reportviewer") that can be run locally to open the generated vulnerability report for inspection in a web browser.

The reportviewer can be tested by uploading the provided sample vulnerability report (in vularis/report).
